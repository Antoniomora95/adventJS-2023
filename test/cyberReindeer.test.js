/*
Santa ðŸŽ… is testing his new electric sled, the CyberReindeer,
on a North Pole road. The road is represented by a string of characters, where:

. = Road
S = Santa's Sled
* = Open barrier
| = Closed barrier
Example of a road: S...|....|.....

Each unit of time, the sled moves one position to the right.
If it encounters a closed barrier, it stops until the barrier opens.
If it is open, it goes through directly.

All barriers start closed, but after 5 units of time, they all open forever.

Create a function that simulates the sled's movement
for a given time and returns an array of strings representing
the state of the road at each unit of time:
